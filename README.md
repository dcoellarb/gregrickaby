## Code review summary

For review this code i have place // REVIEW: ... and {/\* REVIEW:... comments across the application, should be simple to search for "REVIEW:" to find them all.

Now here is a summary of my findings:

1. Most the code seams very well done, structure and documented, is really a well done app, with great usage of next js features, show a lot of Knowledge on SEO optimization and web development.

2. One of the first things that caught my attention was the lack of loading.tsx components, but after further review i see that the developer does a great use of Static Server Rendering so since html is mostly build at build time, no need for loading is supported.

3. My improvements findings have been mostly around:

   i. Better error handling

   ii. Validating environment variables

   iii. Sanitation of dynamic html

4. Only one bug found: a wrong double negation on /Components/Comments.tsx line 13
